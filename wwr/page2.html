    <h3>Highlights from the past season</h3>

        <p class="blog1">What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 
            50th year of running trips down the Grand Canyon. This 
            year we ran 36 trips down the Grand Canyon introducing 
            over 800 people to one of our favorite places on earth. 
            We trained 4 new guides and welcomed them to our family. 
            The season started off with some chilly weather in the early 
            season, but our guests braved the cold and loved every minute
            of their trip (show pictures). Later the temperatures soared 
            reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon.
            We didn't have any trouble getting people in the water at those 
            temperatures.

            It started with the crisp mountain air and the sound of rushing water. We strapped
            on our life jackets, gripped our paddles tightly, and pushed off into the river. The 
            first rapid came fast and fierce, drenching us with icy water and laughter. As we twisted 
            and turned through the canyon, the thrill was unmatched. Our raft bounced like a cork, 
            dodging rocks and plunging into swirling pools. Each shout of "Paddle!" from our guide 
            turned into a chorus of excitement and adrenaline. By the end, we were soaked to the bone, 
            grinning ear to ear, and already planning our next trip. The river had tested us, thrilled 
            us, and left us in awe of its raw power. White water rafting wasn't just funâ€”it was unforgettable.
