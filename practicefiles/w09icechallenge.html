        <p class="main ">A bridge is more than steel and stone; its 
            a passage connecting worlds unknown. Spanning rivers wide
            and valleys deep, bridges carry stories and secrets we keep.
            From towering suspension arcs to humble wooden planks, they 
            bring together lands that once stood apart. Built on dreams 
            and drawn by plans, every bridge begins as an idea that spans. 
            Across rivers, over chasms, through cities grand, bridges stand 
            resilient, weathered by times hand. They rise with strength, 
            they bow with grace, bringing life to every place.
